# Arduino LED Chaser Project

## Description
This Arduino project creates a LED chaser (running light) effect using 5 LEDs.
The LEDs turn on one by one from pin 1 to pin 5 and then reverse.

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno / Nano
- 5 LEDs
- 5 × 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Pin Configuration
| Arduino Pin | Component |
|------------|-----------|
| 1–5        | LEDs      |

## How It Works
- LEDs turn on sequentially with a delay of 200ms.
- After reaching the last LED, the sequence reverses.

## Code
See `arduino_led_chaser.ino`
